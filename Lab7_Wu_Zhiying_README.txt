Manual Testing
As mentioned by my TA Hardison Wang, since I'm not familiar with writing unit tests using Jest, so for this lab, I used manual testings and make sure the webpage renders without errors.

Test Cases and Results:

Theme Switcher (Light/Dark Mode)
Test Case 1: Toggle between light and dark mode
Steps:
1. Click the "Switch to Dark Mode" button.
2. Observe the theme change to dark mode.
3. Click the "Switch to Light Mode" button.
4. Observe the theme change back to light mode.

Result: The theme toggles between light and dark mode successfully.

Test Case 2: Persist theme after page refresh
Steps:
1. Set the theme to dark mode.
2. Refresh the page.
3. Observe the theme remains in dark mode.

Result: The theme persists after a page refresh.

Test Case 3: Apply theme to the entire application
Steps:
1. Toggle the theme and navigate to different pages (e.g., Home, Projects).
2. Observe the theme consistency across all pages.

Result: The theme is applied consistently across all pages.


Interactive Skill List
Test Case 1: Filter skills by searching for keywords
Steps:
1. Enter a keyword (e.g., "Frontend") in the search box.
2. Observe the skills list updating dynamically.

Result: Only skills matching the keyword is displayed.

Test Case 2: Filter skills by clicking checkboxes or buttons
Steps:
1. Click a checkbox or button to filter skills by category (e.g., "Frontend").
2. Observe the skills list updating dynamically.

Result: Only skills matching the selected category is displayed.

Test Case 3: Dynamic search results
Steps:
1. Start typing a keyword (e.g., "F").
2. Observe the skills list updating dynamically as you type.

Result: The skills list update in real-time as the user types.


Projects Page
Test Case 1: Fetch and display projects from the API
Steps:
1. Navigate to the Projects page.
2. Observe the list of projects being displayed.

Result: The projects is fetched from the API and displayed correctly with their name, author, languages, and description.

Test Case 2: Handle API errors gracefully
Steps:
1. Simulate an API error (e.g., by modifying the backend to return an error).
2. Observe the error message displayed on the Projects page.

Result: An error message is displayed if the API fails to fetch projects.


Weather Information on Home Page
Test Case 1: Fetch and display weather information
Steps:
1. Navigate to the Home page.
2. Observe the weather information being displayed.
Result: The weather information (Halifax city, temperature, humidity, wind) is fetched from the API and displayed correctly.


Responsiveness
Test Case 1: Test responsiveness on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
Steps:
1. Open the application on a desktop browser and resize the window.
2. Use browser developer tools to simulate a mobile view.

Result: The application looks good and respond well to different screen sizes, and the hamburger menu appears on small screens and allow navigation.

```

The code above was created by adapting the code in [Bootstrap v5.0](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/) as shown below: 

```
<link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.0.2/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet" integrity="sha384-EVSTQN3/azprG1Anm3QDgpJLIm9Nao0Yz1ztcQTwFspd3yD65VohhpuuCOmLASjC" crossorigin="anonymous">

```

- <!---How---> The code in [Bootstrap v5.0](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/) was implemented by linking the Bootstrap CSS and JavaScript files directly from a CDN (Content Delivery Network), which allows for an efficient way to access and utilise the latest version of Bootstrap without needing to download the files.
- <!---Why---> [Bootstrap v5.0](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/)'s Code was used because it provides a robust framework that simplifies the process of creating responsive and modern web designs. 
- <!---How---> [Bootstrap v5.0](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/)'s Code was modified by adding custom styles for more personalised UI elements in the About.js, Footer.js, Header.js, Home.js, NotFound.js and Projects.js. For example, in the About.js file, the text alignment and padding were adjusted, and in the Projects.js file, background colours and padding were customised to create a visually appealing and engaging layout.

import { BrowserRouter as Router, Routes, Route } from 'react-router-dom';
import Header from './components/Header';
import Footer from './components/Footer';
import Home from './components/Home'; 
import About from './components/About';
import Projects from './components/Projects';
import NotFound from './components/NotFound'; 
import Skills from './components/Skills';
import React from 'react';
import ThemeSwitcher from './components/ThemeSwitcher';

import './App.css';

function App() {
  return (
    <Router>
      <Header />
      <ThemeSwitcher /> 
      <Routes>
        <Route path="/" element={<Home />} />
        <Route path="/about" element={<About />} />
        <Route path="/projects" element={<Projects />} />
        <Route path="/skills" element={<Skills />} />
        <Route path="*" element={<NotFound />} />
      </Routes>
      <Footer />
    </Router>
  );
}

export default App;

```

The code above was created by adapting the code in [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/react/react_router.asp) as shown below: 

```
import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client";
import { BrowserRouter, Routes, Route } from "react-router-dom";
import Layout from "./pages/Layout";
import Home from "./pages/Home";
import Blogs from "./pages/Blogs";
import Contact from "./pages/Contact";
import NoPage from "./pages/NoPage";

export default function App() {
  return (
    <BrowserRouter>
      <Routes>
        <Route path="/" element={<Layout />}>
          <Route index element={<Home />} />
          <Route path="blogs" element={<Blogs />} />
          <Route path="contact" element={<Contact />} />
          <Route path="*" element={<NoPage />} />
        </Route>
      </Routes>
    </BrowserRouter>
  );
}

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(<App />);

```

- <!---How---> The code in [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/react/react_router.asp) was implemented by importing and using the BrowserRouter component from react-router-dom to handle routing in the application. The Routes component is used to define multiple Route components that link different paths to specific components like Home, About, Projects, and NotFound. The Header and Footer components are added to the layout for consistency across pages.
- <!---Why---> [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/react/react_router.asp)'s Code was used because it provides a simple way to handle routing within a React application. 
- <!---How---> [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/react/react_router.asp)'s Code was modified by modifying the routes to reflect the different pages of the personal portfolio, such as the Home, About, Skills, and Projects components. Also, customising the layout by adding the Header and Footer components that appear on every page, and updating the Route paths to match the projectâ€™s structure. Including a ThemeSwitcher component to enable theme customisation.

The code above was created by adapting the code in [Lab6: Tutorial video codes from TA Hardison Wang](https://ca.bbcollab.com/guest/43ed01fcfba449b1aae234d5b0bc6520) as shown below: 

```
function Header () {
   Return (
   <h1> This is my header</h1>
   );
}

```

- <!---How---> The code in [Lab6: Tutorial video codes from TA Hardison Wang](https://ca.bbcollab.com/guest/43ed01fcfba449b1aae234d5b0bc6520) was implemented by using a simple Header function that returns JSX to display a header. In the original code, the header was very simple (<h1> This is my header</h1>), whereas in this case, I enhanced it by using the react-router-dom package to create a responsive navigation bar with links to different pages of the portfolio (Home, About, Projects).
- <!---Why---> [Lab6: Tutorial video codes from TA Hardison Wang](https://ca.bbcollab.com/guest/43ed01fcfba449b1aae234d5b0bc6520)'s Code was used because because it provided a basic structure for creating a header in a React component.  
- <!---How---> [Lab6: Tutorial video codes from TA Hardison Wang](https://ca.bbcollab.com/guest/43ed01fcfba449b1aae234d5b0bc6520)'s Code was modified by sdding the react-router-dom package to implement navigation links (Link) to different pages (Home, About, Projects), replacing the basic <h1> tag with a more complex navigation bar using Bootstrap 5 to make it responsive, and adding additional Bootstrap classes for styling and responsiveness, such as navbar, navbar-expand-lg, navbar-light, and bg-light, along with the button to toggle the navbar on smaller screens.

The dotenv package was included to manage environment variables, and cors middleware was added to allow cross-origin requests. The router handles a GET request at the root (/), returning a JSON response with "Hello World!". Finally, the application is mounted under /.netlify/functions/api, making it accessible as a serverless function on Netlify.

I want to implement a theme switcher (light/dark mode) using React state (useState), where users should be able to toggle between light mode and dark mode, and the theme should persist after page refresh (hint: use localStorage).

```

The code prompt above was used [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/) to generate the code shown below: 

```
import React, { useState, useEffect } from "react";

const ThemeSwitcher = () => {
  const [theme, setTheme] = useState(localStorage.getItem("theme") || "light");

  useEffect(() => {
    document.body.className = theme;
    localStorage.setItem("theme", theme);
  }, [theme]);

  const toggleTheme = () => {
    setTheme((prevTheme) => (prevTheme === "light" ? "dark" : "light"));
  };

  return (
    <div className="min-h-screen flex flex-col items-center justify-center">
      <h1 className="text-2xl mb-4">Theme Switcher</h1>
      <button
        className="px-4 py-2 rounded-lg bg-gray-800 text-white dark:bg-gray-200 dark:text-black"
        onClick={toggleTheme}
      >
        Switch to {theme === "light" ? "Dark" : "Light"} Mode
      </button>
    </div>
  );
};

export default ThemeSwitcher;

```

#### File Name
ThemeSwitcher.js

```
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

const ThemeSwitcher = () => {
  //Initialize the state from localStorage if available
  const [theme, setTheme] = useState(localStorage.getItem('theme') || 'light');

  //Update the theme and save it to localStorage
  const toggleTheme = () => {
    const newTheme = theme === 'light' ? 'dark' : 'light';
    setTheme(newTheme);
    localStorage.setItem('theme', newTheme);
  };

  //Apply the theme class to the document body
  useEffect(() => {
    document.body.className = theme;
  }, [theme]);

  return (
    <button onClick={toggleTheme} className="theme-switcher">
      Switch to {theme === 'light' ? 'Dark' : 'Light'} Mode
    </button>
  );
};

export default ThemeSwitcher;

```

- <!---How---> The code in [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/) was implemented by fetching the theme from localStorage when the component loads, using useState to manage the theme state (light or dark), using useEffect to apply the selected theme to the document.body and update localStorage, and providing a button that allows users to toggle between themes.
- <!---Why---> [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/)'s Code was used because it leverages React best practices, including useState and useEffect, and provides a simple and efficient implementation of a theme switcher.
- <!---How---> [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/)'s Code was modified by refactoring the toggleTheme function to use setTheme((prevTheme) => (prevTheme === "light" ? "dark" : "light")), making it more readable, and editing the css to make the UI design more appealing.

I want to implement an interactive skill list using React state (useState), where visitors should be able to filter skills by searching for keywords of category and by clicking (e.g. text with checkbox, buttons). Search result display is on the fly (e.g., while the visitor is typing in the search
box or checked a checkbox, before clicking any button such as â€˜searchâ€™ or â€˜confirmâ€™) and
the result is populated properly on the page.

- <!---How---> The code in [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/) was implemented in a React component that dynamically filters and displays a list of skills. It uses React's useState to manage user input for searching and filtering by category. The filtering logic updates in real time as users type or check/uncheck categories. 
- <!---Why---> [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/)'s Code was used because it efficiently handles searching, filtering, and live updates.
- <!---How---> [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/)'s Code was modified by adjusting the skill list structure to include unique IDs, improving the filtering logic to support both keyword searches and category selections, and adding a "Clear Filters" button to enhance user experience.
